# Why I Built This
I built this program to help me study for the Grade 9 Finals Exam. Update: I inserted all of the pdf materials for every subject into ChatGPT, formatted everything into the desired json format. Learned with this program, an hour everyday for a week. And gained 90+ out of 100 for all of my exams in all subjects ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
